// ponytail: a run mid-transition is re-checked faster than its own RequeueAfter, because a running process is only visible by asking it: the observation is a sample, not a report. Sweep on the drain harness at 1000 runs and parallelism 20 through ExecPod: 250ms 17.147s, 50ms 7.633s, 25ms 7.115s, 10ms 7.100s with 22 percent more reconciles, so the knee is here. It applies only to a runner that cannot report completion itself; the worker host is woken by its own terminal event, so clamping it there was measured as pure added cost.
