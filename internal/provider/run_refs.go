// ponytail: recordRunRef runs the moment a workload starts, so the record exists before any later pass can read the run back; keepRunRef refreshes it once per pass and clears it on the cached phase rather than on the phase this pass computed, because the record has to outlive the terminal transition. A cached copy that still says Pending must keep finding it, or it would ask for a start the provider has already done. runRefTTL is the backstop for a run whose object is deleted before its status ever reads terminal.

// ponytail: refuse to start a run this provider already started, so a cached copy that predates this pass's own start write cannot start a second workload. denorun is a stateless decider whose only memory is the status it is handed, so without this it asks to start again and the provider obeys: measured on the drain harness at 1000 runs and parallelism 20, 1062 starts for 1000 runs with 73 workloads live against a parallelism of 20. Two legitimate things must not be mistaken for staleness. A retry is one: denorun clears RunID on failure and returns the run to Pending, so Retries or StartTime in the cached object means the run has run before and is asking again. A recreated object behind the same name is the other, and it carries a new UID.

// ponytail: activeRuns counts workloads this provider started and has not yet seen reach a terminal phase, with the high-water mark kept for measurement. It is the gauge that found the duplicate starts above, which were invisible everywhere else: the API server only ever saw one object per run and the wall clock did not move.
